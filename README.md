# React like library
### This is React-like library to understand how React works internally
Build your own Reactjs from scratch

Welcome to my blog post series on creating a React-like library to understand how React works internally. In this series, I’ll be sharing my experience of building a library that mimics the functionality of React and explaining how it works.
React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It’s widely used in the industry and has a large community of developers contributing to its development. However, understanding how React works internally can be challenging, especially for beginners.
That’s why I decided to create a React-like library from scratch to gain a better understanding of how React works under the hood. In this series, I’ll be sharing my experience of building this library and explaining the concepts behind it.
