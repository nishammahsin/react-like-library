The code is a simple implementation of the `createRoot` function that takes a `container`` as an argument and returns an object with a render method. 
The render method takes an element as an argument and sets the `innerHTML`` of the container to a string that contains the element wrapped in a span tag.

```
const createRoot = function (container) {
    return {
      render: function (element) {
        container.innerHTML = '<span>' + element + '</span>';
      }
    };
};

export { createRoot }
```
Here’s what the code does step by step:

The createRoot function takes a container as an argument.

The function returns an object with a single method called render.

The render method takes an element as an argument.

The method sets the innerHTML of the container to a string that contains the element wrapped in a span tag.

Please note that this is not the final code and is just meant to be a starting point.

The render function is still incomplete and won’t be able to render JSX.
However, this will be covered in the coming chapters.
